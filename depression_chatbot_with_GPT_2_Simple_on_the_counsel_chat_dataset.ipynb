              "\"<p>What you are describing is something psychologists have termed &#34;triangulation&#34; which is what happens when one family member will not talk to the one they have a problem with and goes to a third member of the family to complain instead. You have been &#34;triangulated&#34; by your wife and mother.</p><p>This is often seen in families. It's seen everywhere. How many times have you had a problem with someone but you didn't go to them to tell them, you went to someone else to complain? It is usually difficult for a person to confront another, especially in relationships where there is a power differential. For example, I bet it's easier to complain to a coworker about your boss rather than go to the boss with your complaint.</p><p>I'm not saying triangulation is always a bad thing. Sometimes a third party mediator is needed to help solve problems between two people who disagree. That's what therapists do every day! Sometimes just getting someone else's perspective can help you see the issue clearer. However, in your situation it sounds like this is becoming a problem. You are stuck in the middle between two people that love you and that you love.</p><p>If you want to put a stop to this triangulation, you will need to encourage the two of them to talk to each other and work out their differences. Perhaps it was a simple misunderstanding that some open communication can clear up. Even if they really don't like each other and can't get along, your relationship with the both of them is going to continue to deteriorate the longer you are stuck in the middle.\\xa0</p><p>Try to understand what might be the feelings behind their behavior. It is possible that they may both feel threatened by the other. These are the two most important women in your life and they both know it. Your mother may be afraid that she will lose you if she confronts your wife. I heard one mother-in-law describe her son's wife as the gateway to her son. The wife has the power to dictate when and how often the mother gets to see her son. The wife also is the gateway to the grandchildren. If your wife doesn't like her mother-in-law she can severely hamper or damage her mother-in-law's relationship with you and any children you two may have. From your wife's viewpoint, this is the woman that she may feel like she can never live up to. If you regularly praise your mom's cooking, her housework, gardening, or anything else your wife may feel that you are putting down her own efforts in these areas and can feel unappreciated. This can be especially difficult if your wife and mother are nothing alike. I am not saying that this is the case with your family's situation. These are just a few examples from other families in a similar situation as yours.\\xa0</p><p>Regardless of what the cause is, if this dysfunctional pattern is allowed to continue, your mom and your wife will begin to get upset with you when you don't agree with them. They will get upset if you don't align yourself with them against the other. They will be offended when it seems like you are choosing the other one's side or that you are not standing up for them like they think you should. In worst cases, if it continues to escalate you may even find yourself in the impossible position of having to choose between your wife and your mother which may mean cutting off contact with the other, ending that relationship. Change the dynamics before it spirals even further.</p>\""

Good afternoon everyone!&nbsp;My name is Mark, and I am your therapist and one of your primary focus areas.&nbsp; This is something I find helpful in my own practice.&nbsp;</p><p>One of my first tasks in therapy is to identify patients who are vulnerable to trauma and bring them into therapy to be more aware of what is actually happening through the trauma they experience, but also what is behind their experiences.&nbsp; For this reason, my first and foremost goal here is to find out if there are some individuals that you would like to have in therapy who aren't suffering from the trauma they feel.&nbsp; This helps me to identify who they are, how they experience trauma, what the relationship is like in that relationship, and then how they are able to find a way to heal themselves if possible.&nbsp;</p><p>Also, I find that there are a number of ways in therapeutic and therapeutic relationships where there is the ability to be part of healing by exploring the relationship you are in.&nbsp;This is where the focus of this blog is so you can get a better understanding of how to start.&nbsp;</p><p>Here are a few links to see a few helpful resources.&nbsp;<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">&nbsp;</span></p><p><o:nop style=\"line-height: -1px; line-height: 1.4285747794285748px;\">&nbsp;</o:nop>&nbsp;</p><p>http://www.psychologytoday.com/page/how-can-a-couple-be-successful-when-they-have-a-couple-relationship-connection&nbsp; </o:nop></p><p>And here is a link to a resource file that explains the process in a helpful way that will help you understand why you are going through this process of discovering what is going on in the relationship and what is causing your trauma.&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1px; background-image: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-position: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-position: initial;\">&nbsp;</span\n",

I recently saw him and he talked about something and offered to help with something. He has not offered.<!/question!><!answer!><p>Sometimes, you have to wait for the right person to come along. This is always hard because even though a relationship ends, the relationship has not ended, and it can go on and on for many years and still be a good relationship. It can also be really hard to stay together, because as long as your relationship remains good, it will always be good. There are different things to take care of, and I'm not sure how often you can do that. You could find someone, or maybe send someone to go along with you to get it, and if you are able, you can talk about how you want to handle it and what you would like to have happen. It may seem hard, but it's okay to make that decision. That doesn't mean that that person is the right person for you. It does mean that you didn't do too much, but try and find someone that you can talk about your feelings with. If you cannot find someone, maybe there are things you can do instead. I know this sounds hard, but this can be really hard. I want to take this time to give you some thoughts. I have so many thoughts that I want to write about, and I'm not sure how I can help you at this time. But I do want to say that I have been with him a little bit now, but I think he is having a hard time. I know it sounds as if he is upset and it makes his heart racing, so I want to give you some thoughts here.<br><!/answer!><!question!> I don't feel like talking to my parents anymore. They have been gone so long, but that does not feel like they are still around. My parents are not home. It really makes me not want to go to school anymore, but what do I do?<!/question!><!answer!><p>I'm pretty sure you can't really change your parents, but there are ways to feel different. You could talk to your parents in any way that will allow you to feel just those feelings you're experiencing now. Maybe give your parents a time out, a chance to talk with somebody that you can talk with about what your feelings are. I would not recommend going to a certain places or seeing people. Try to stay in your own home and let your parents talk with you. If they cannot reach you, I would suggest looking into other places where you can get some support than this. Also, if they are not available, if you feel like going to see a doctor\n",

My parents are both military doctors, but my mom usually stays home. They have been fighting for me now for years.\n",
            "Most recently, my mom got sick and forced me out. I stayed in my parents' house and fought tooth and nail to keep it together.  This week, I found out that my mom is actually gay. I can't really talk with my parents directly so I asked if they could talk to me. They said no. I was afraid of being kicked out of the house and now I'm afraid they will never let me into their house.<!/question!><!answer!><p>If your mom is unable to talk with you directly, then my question is what you're afraid is going to happen next from not knowing what's going to happen right now. That's something I imagine many others will be willing to do too.</p><p>I would recommend that you talk directly with your parents about your concerns before making any changes. They could talk about what you're experiencing in relation to your sexual orientation, your fear, if you have a fear of being kicked out or you have a specific medical emergency, then talk about that too.</p><!/answer!><!question!> My friend is really bad at school. He's from Ireland and plays video games all the time. I always play in the busier weather than in Ireland, so I play the school bus just to get to know him on a level playing field. He has a rough past that I learned long ago, but I grew up wanting to live my life the way I wanted to live it. I feel like the only way I can handle being in this position is if I make any changes. I don't want to go to the locker room or bathroom.<!/question!><!answer!><p>Hello, and thank you for your question. Sometimes being in a situation where the situation is the source of constant anxiety for you, is a good place to begin. I'm not sure that anxiety and the surrounding emotions would be a good mix in order to work together to address the problem in a healthy way. For example, I'd think that your friend might be working with you on coping skills and possibly speaking with you about your concerns. This would be a great opportunity for the two to engage in discussion and allow the other to have \"anxiety therapy\". You're suggesting that you have a \"mental health\" disorder and that your friend is at this area because the anxiety is getting in the way of what you can actually do or do in the immediate environment. You mention that he's from Ireland, does he actually? I'm pretty sure that he's from a particular religion or some other local custom, and it's understandable that some people would try to talk with you about different things, but if his behavior is outside of his beliefs, or if he uses or expresses his own opinions, then the possibility of a lot of differences, is very low. I don't know what kind of anxiety or disorder you have, but I understand that you are working with him to understand your own beliefs and feelings. I don't know if your friend has specific anxiety or disorder about using substances, but if he has any type of anxiety that doesn't affect how you communicate in a healthy way, then I can just imagine having to speak to his therapist to get an answer to your question.</p><!/answer!><!question!> I've been diagnosed with anxiety disorder by my family doctor. The family doctor is the person's supervisor and I think he either gives me medical permission to continue to try something new, or he makes us all feel unsafe at times. It’s always been a tough spot for me, but I need to get past my own symptoms. Am I depressed, or is it just being anxious? I have anxiety from the fact I'm being evaluated and that my family doctor is treating me badly.<!/question!><!answer!><p>This sounds frustrating, and yes, there are many things going on here. The list for this is actually quite long. There are a few theories here, all of which can be quite unsettling for your spouse. On one level, I think your symptoms point me towards a sense of \"depression.\" I also think that this is something you're trying to manage with medication, although it's not necessarily necessary. This is a very confusing situation, and you may need a combination of both to find the right solution. Also, what about your friends? Do you ever notice what you're asking of your family doctor? There are friendships with people who are closely connected to your doctor's office, and all the relationships that you'd expect on\n",

There is no safe place for you as to what might happen when you are experiencing depression without first getting help as to it by a loved one or a colleague. &nbsp;</p><p>A professional can't diagnose depression without first first getting your own support so you know exactly what might happen if you do find yourself feeling like this.</p><p>Once you know the feelings of depression within you and the person has acknowledged them, it's possible for you to begin trying to talk with them. &nbsp;This takes some time and effort, but it certainly gives you insight into those around you.&nbsp;</p><p>The good news is that you don't have to be alone with this! Depression symptoms can easily develop into anxiety symptoms if for some reason you find yourself having difficult or overwhelming feelings. A professional can help you either talk to your depression counselor (an individual therapist who does not specialize in depression) about your feelings and discuss your challenges and understand your symptoms and feelings, or visit your local Depression Center (1-800-273-8255) to get you started. The first visit can take anywhere from 10-30 minutes, although you can choose to make a quick detour if you know that there are still some things you can't do right away.&nbsp;</p><p>Here's a good starting place to have some self-care activities in case you feel that you are having some distress when you first start working through the situation.</p><!/answer!><!question!> I've gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime I walk in I get nervous and shaky.  Is this normal? Should I still be feeling like this?<!/question!><!answer!><p>I would say that there isn't anything to worry about. Therapy can be extremely uncomfortable and sometimes times anxiety and panic attacks can be a health hazard. Even though having these thoughts are uncomfortable, I would think it would be best to get medical care for you so it would be a good idea to have immediate medical attention necessary so you don't have to endure these feelings again. If it is the other way around, there is no guarantee that they will still be there, and hopefully it doesn't have to be something that many people have experienced before. It can all feel so new, and if you haven't already, give yourself some time and be patient with your new ability to think. This may just be what is going on in your head at the time of seeking treatment.</p><!/answer!><!question!> I keep having this same feeling, but it doesn't stop it.<!/question!><!answer!><p>Sometimes I don't feel as though I'm being heard and I think it's time for us to take a break or even rest.

It can be difficult to answer this kind of question because you typically want to answer \"how did this event occur?\", in this case, from a young age. &nbsp;It goes without saying that your actions did and still is wrong.&nbsp;</p><p>I know from experience that young people are drawn to groups or individuals that they can trust. &nbsp;Even when we do not know the people involved in a serious matter, it can be good to talk with them and learn more about their background and reasons for being not following rules. &nbsp;Having trust in adults can be difficult to find in young people at times, though. &nbsp;</p><p>You are right that it is very difficult to find trust in groups and individuals. &nbsp;I'd be open to talk with your about your experiences with this boy or girl. :)</p><p>The question that remains is whether or not this behaviour is conducive to good adult social relationships. &nbsp;I have worked with many people who have found that friendships with significant others are elusive and often do not develop into meaningful associations as they age. &nbsp;</p><p>It is also difficult to say what is \"good\" about your relationship and whether it is working for you as a person. &nbsp;As you age, and you develop a deeper understanding of the reason you feel so strongly in your heart for not coming to trust a person, it becomes easier and now even more beneficial to do so. &nbsp;I'd encourage you to consider your own wishes about the relationship and do them, especially if all you desire in a relationship is some level of connection. &nbsp;</p><p>Thank you for reaching out and having a dialogue.

If my dad doesn’t believe me, then my mom goes along with my dad and acts like she doesn’t believe me either. I’ve never liked my parents. I’m never happy. I don’t know how to make them happy.
